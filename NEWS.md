# arulesViz 1.2-1 (03/12/2017)

* arules_plotly uses now signif instead of round for quality measures. 
* arules_plotly shows correct rule indices for too large rule sets. 
* arules_plotly implements now jitter to reduce overplotting (defaults
    to .1 if overplotting would occur)
* regular scatter plot also defaults jitter to .2 if overplotting would occur.
* plot method "grouped" now shows the most interesting items instead of the
  most frequent items to represent antecedents. Also, if more than 10 RHS
  items are found, then only the 10 most important are shown (see control 
  argument rhs_max)
* scatterplot now handles Inf with a warning.
